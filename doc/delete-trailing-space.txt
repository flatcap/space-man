*delete-trailing-space.txt*  Delete trailing whitespace

INTRODUCTION                                           *delete-trailing-space*

'delete-trailing-space' will remove any whitespace from the beginning of lines.
Here, whitespace means space, tab or carriage return characters.

This plugin is part of the |space-man| plugin.

MAPPINGS                                      *delete-trailing-space-mappings*

'delete-leading-space' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The local mappings work on a Line, Motion or Visual region
The file mappings work on the entire File, all Args, Buffers or Windows.

Plugin mappings:

  Line    <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceL
  Motion  <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceM
  Visual  <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceV
  Args    <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceA
  Buffers <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceB
  File    <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceF
  Window  <plug>DeleteTrailingSpaceW

Default user mappings:

  Line    <leader><space>tt
  Motion  <leader><space>t
  Visual  <leader><space>t
  Args    <leader>a<space>t
  Buffers <leader>b<space>t
  File    <leader>f<space>t
  Window  <leader>w<space>t

EXAMPLES                                      *delete-trailing-space-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
