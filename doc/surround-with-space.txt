INTRODUCTION                                             *surround-with-space*

'surround-with-space' surrounds words, lines or blocks with spaces

This plugin is part of the |space-man| plugin.

MAPPINGS                                        *surround-with-space-mappings*

'surround-with-space' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The local mappings work on a Line, Motion or Visual region

Plugin mappings:

  Line    <plug>SurroundWithSpaceL
  Motion  <plug>SurroundWithSpaceM
  Visual  <plug>SurroundWithSpaceV

Default user mappings:

  Line    <leader><space>ss
  Motion  <leader><space>s
  Visual  <leader><space>s

EXAMPLES                                        *surround-with-space-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
