INTRODUCTION                                             *surround-with-space*

'surround-with-space' surrounds words, lines or blocks with spaces

MAPPINGS                                        *surround-with-space-mappings*

'surround-with-space' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The local mappings work on a Line, Motion or Visual region

Plugin mappings:

  Line    <plug>SurroundWithSpaceL
  Motion  <plug>SurroundWithSpaceM
  Visual  <plug>SurroundWithSpaceV

Default user mappings:

  Line    <leader><space>ss
  Motion  <leader><space>s
  Visual  <leader><space>s

EXAMPLES                                        *surround-with-space-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.

CONFIGURATION                                     *surround-with-space-config*

'surround-with-space' is controlled by two global variables which both default to 1 (true).
The first to enable the function, the second to create default user mappings.
e.g.  For DeleteEmptyLines,
>
  let g:space_man_enable_surround_with_space          = 1
  let g:space_man_create_mappings_surround_with_space = 1
