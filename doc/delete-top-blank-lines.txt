INTRODUCTION                                          *delete-top-blank-lines*

'delete-top-blank-lines' deletes any blank lines from the top of a file.
That is lines with zero characters, or lines containing only spaces and tabs.

MAPPINGS                                     *delete-top-blank-lines-mappings*

'delete-top-blank-lines' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The file mappings work on the entire File, all Args, Buffers or Windows.

Plugin mappings:

  Args    <plug>BlankLinesTopA
  Buffers <plug>BlankLinesTopB
  File    <plug>BlankLinesTopF
  Window  <plug>BlankLinesTopW

Default user mappings:

  Args    <leader>a<enter>gg
  Buffers <leader>b<enter>gg
  File    <leader>f<enter>gg
  Window  <leader>w<enter>gg

EXAMPLES                                     *delete-top-blank-lines-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
