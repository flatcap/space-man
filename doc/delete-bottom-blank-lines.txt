*delete-bottom-blank-lines.txt*  Delete blank lines from the bottom of a file

INTRODUCTION                                       *delete-bottom-blank-lines*

'delete-bottom-blank-lines' deletes any blank lines from the bottom of a file.
That is lines with zero characters, or lines containing only spaces and tabs.

This plugin is part of the |space-man| plugin.

MAPPINGS                                  *delete-bottom-blank-lines-mappings*

'delete-bottom-blank-lines' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The file mappings work on the entire File, all Args, Buffers or Windows.

Plugin mappings:

  Args    <plug>DeleteBottomBlankLinesA
  Buffers <plug>DeleteBottomBlankLinesB
  File    <plug>DeleteBottomBlankLinesF
  Window  <plug>DeleteBottomBlankLinesW

Default user mappings:

  Args    <leader>a<enter>G
  Buffers <leader>b<enter>G
  File    <leader>f<enter>G
  Window  <leader>w<enter>G

EXAMPLES                                  *delete-bottom-blank-lines-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
