INTRODUCTION                                            *delete-leading-space*

'delete-leading-space' will remove any leading whitespace.
That is space, or tab, characters at the beginning of lines.

MAPPINGS                                       *delete-leading-space-mappings*

'delete-leading-space' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The local mappings work on a Line, Motion or Visual region
The file mappings work on the entire File, all Args, Buffers or Windows.

Plugin mappings:

  Line    <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceL
  Motion  <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceM
  Visual  <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceV
  Args    <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceA
  Buffers <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceB
  File    <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceF
  Window  <plug>DeleteLeadingSpaceW

Default user mappings:

  Line    <leader><space>ll
  Motion  <leader><space>l
  Visual  <leader><space>l
  Args    <leader>a<space>l
  Buffers <leader>b<space>l
  File    <leader>f<space>l
  Window  <leader>w<space>l

EXAMPLES                                       *delete-leading-space-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
