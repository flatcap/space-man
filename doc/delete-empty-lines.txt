*delete-empty-lines.txt*  Delete empty lines

INTRODUCTION                                              *delete-empty-lines*

'delete-empty-lines' will delete any empty lines in a file.
That is lines with zero characters, or lines containing only spaces and tabs.

This plugin is part of the |space-man| plugin.

MAPPINGS                                         *delete-empty-lines-mappings*

'delete-empty-lines' creates a set of <Plug> mappings.
The local mappings work on a Line, Motion or Visual region
The file mappings work on the entire File, all Args, Buffers or Windows.

Plugin mappings:

  Line    <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesL
  Motion  <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesM
  Visual  <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesV
  Args    <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesA
  Buffers <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesB
  File    <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesF
  Window  <plug>DeleteEmptyLinesW

Default user mappings:

  Line    <leader><enter>dd
  Motion  <leader><enter>d
  Visual  <leader><enter>d
  Args    <leader>a<enter>d
  Buffers <leader>b<enter>d
  File    <leader>f<enter>d
  Window  <leader>w<enter>d

EXAMPLES                                         *delete-empty-lines-examples*

These examples assume the <Leader> is set to its default value of
\ (backslash) and the plugin is using its default user mappings.
